IF,ELSE,ELIF,NESTED

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b

Not Equals: a != b

Less than: a < b

Less than or equal to: a <= b

Greater than: a > b

Greater than or equal to: a >= b 

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
